# UltraSoftCore
**Important: This mod requires Java 8 to run!**

A Minecraft Forge mod aimed to make your life considerably harder but not as hard as UltraHardCore.
Scroll down to the Features list if you don't like poorly written lore (I won't blame you).

## Introduction
For years the people of the Minecraft universe enjoyed the blessings of the Creators, being revived after getting blown to bits by a sneaky Creeper, never suffering from any wounds no matter how many arrows you have stuck in your body or how often you got bitten by spiders. Not only that, but you even regain health over time as long as your tummy is full enough.
With the people being so careless about their health and lifes one of these Creators decided something had to change, people needed to be wary about their bodies and the states they're in. No longer will you get revived without having to worry about anything. No longer can you go into a battle with 10 skeletons, slaying them all while looking like a needle cushion and come out without a scratch.
Death should be a final state with no coming back, but after having seen this rule laid down for a while they got bored since there were no people left for their entertainment. And so this Creator decided to make things hard, but fair.
The people will still get resurrected after death, but every death will weaken their body more and more. They will become more frail, weakening their ability to naturally restore health over time, making their skin and bones more fragile and susceptible to injuries.

After all this was said and done this Creator decided to get a closer look at this world that follows their new rules and thus they wandered around the world.
On their journey this Creator discovered that the light behaved very weird in this world. Even in the deepest caves where not the slightest shimmer of light hit, the blocks were still somehow reflecting light which simply defies all logic. And so this Creator decided to do something about that.
Darkness is now something the people actually have to fear and do something about. No longer will you be able to start exploring caves with just a handful of torches and when you eventually run out you'll just have to deal with the slight inconvenience of slightly darker surroundings. Caves will actually go pitch black unless you light them somehow, hiding whatever is lurking in those caves.

But even Creators have something similar to sympathy, and after watching countless "adventurers" going into caves unprepared and getting eaten and turned by Zombies and Skeletons this particular Creator decided to bless the world with what they call "Glowballs".
They appear to be small somewhat fragile balls that house a mixture of certain glowing dusts. When you throw them they would break on impact, releasing their contents to drop on the floor and magically light the area, almost in the same fashion a torch does. Unfortunately they seem to only last for a limited amount of time so their best use might be to throw down a dark cave before you attempt to climb down to light it up with torches.

Who knows what else this bored and slightly sadistic Creator will think of to make the lives of the people harder, or, as they like to call it, "more interesting".
